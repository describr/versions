/** Structure of the front-end user profile and account page URLs. */

### User Profile

Pretty URL: HOME_URL/user/USER_NICENAME
Regular URL: HOME_URL/?page_id=ID-FOR-USER-PAGE&describr_user=USER_NICENAME

### Account Page

Pretty URL: HOME_URL/account
Regular URL: HOME_URL/?page_id=ID-FOR-ACCOUNT-PAGE&describr_tab=general

The describr_user=USER_ID query variable can be added to either format of the account page URLs to locate the account page for a user other than the logged-in user.

The User and Account pages are created during the activation of the plugin and can be found on the Dashboard's Pages screen.
